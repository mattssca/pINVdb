# pINVdb
## Overview
This repository contains the results of an ongoing effort of cataloguing all previously charcterized polymorphic inversions (in reference to GRCh38). This database compiles resources from well established structural variant databases such as dbVAR, DGV and invFest together with more recent findings related to polymorphic inversions such Chiasson et al (2019) and Sanders et al. (2016). This database also includes regions subject to known regions of segmental duplications or Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIR) from Baily et al. & Eichler et al. 


## Access
Full database of inversion intervalls annotated with:
`chr:start:end:size:accession_number:validation_status:global_frequencies:functional_effects:dataset:intesecting_genes` 

Coordinates are avialble as xls spreadsheet and bed format. For bed formatted callset, fields 4-10 are collapsed into one semi-colon seperated variable.
